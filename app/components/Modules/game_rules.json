For 2v2 matches both players must leave within 10 seconds. If this is a matchfinder match and your opponent refuses to replay you must provide proof of lag and leaving within 10 seconds then OCG admins will determine if the match gets cancelled. If, however, in that time you get damaged by another player, pick up items, or your opponent gets a kill/knock the match will stand from that point on. If after this point a player disconnects from the match, the match will not be replayed or cancelled. Any players enrolling in tournaments or matches, you agree to these terms. Valid proof of lag must include video in-game evidence of skipping or freezing, etc."
